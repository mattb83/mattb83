first github repo. Right now and for the past 21 years I have worked in land surveying. It's hard work, and precise.
I have decided to learn how to read and write code and then eventually programming. One reason for this is technology. 
My profession is slowly being replaced by computers, for example, open google maps and look at the elevation at your house. 
In the past, only I could've told you that, and only after some work and math. Another reason is that I'm genuinely excited
when I get my little alert box to pop up and ask you what your favorite color is! I think its neat and want to know enough to
make a career change, hopefully to front-end dev, so far, it seems like what I like the best.
